                        <h2>When Tree Removal Is Actually Needed</h2>
                        <p>Not every problematic tree needs to be removed. Removal should be considered when:</p>
                        
                        <div class="reason-list">

                                <h3>Dead or Dying Trees</h3>
                                <p>A tree with more than 50% dead branches, no leaf growth in season, extensive bark loss, or significant decay is likely beyond saving. Dead trees become brittle and unpredictable, posing serious safety risks.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Structural Instability</h3>
                                <p>Trees with severe lean (especially recent changes), major trunk cracks, significant root damage, or hollow trunks may fail without warning. If a tree leans more than 15 degrees toward structures, it requires professional assessment.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Disease or Infestation Beyond Treatment</h3>
                                <p>Some tree diseases and pest infestations cannot be treated effectively. Removing infected trees prevents spread to healthy trees and protects your landscape investment.</p>

                                <p>Trees planted too close to foundations, sewer lines, or structures may cause ongoing damage that exceeds the cost of removal and replacement with a more suitable species.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h2>When Removal Is NOT Needed</h2>
                        <p>Many homeowners consider removal when other solutions would work better:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="alternative-list">
                            <li><strong>Messy trees:</strong> Seasonal leaf drop, fruit, or sap is natural. Choose native species for new plantings if maintenance is a concern.</li>
                            <li><strong>Too much shade:</strong> Selective pruning (crown thinning) can increase light penetration by 15-30% without removing the tree.</li>
                            <li><strong>Minor branch concerns:</strong> Dead or damaged branches can often be pruned rather than removing the entire tree.</li>
                            <li><strong>View blocking:</strong> Crown raising or selective branch removal may restore views while keeping the tree.</li>
                            <li><strong>Minor lean:</strong> Trees naturally lean toward light. A slight lean (under 10 degrees) is usually not dangerous.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wildlife concerns:</strong> Birds, squirrels, and insects in trees are normal. Removal is rarely the best solution unless there's a health hazard (like bees near an allergic person).</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h3>Get a Second Opinion</h3>
                            <p>If an arborist recommends removal, especially for a large or mature tree, consider getting a second assessment. Some contractors prefer removal (more profitable) when pruning or treatment would be appropriate.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>Permit Requirements in North Vancouver</h2>
                        <p>The District of North Vancouver has strict tree protection bylaws. Here's what you need to know:</p>

                            <h3>When You Need a Permit</h3>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Trees on your property that are designated as "protected"</li>
                                <li>Trees near property lines that may affect neighbors</li>

                            </ul>

                            <h3>Protected Trees</h3>
                            <p>North Vancouver protects certain species and sizes. Protected trees typically cannot be removed without exceptional circumstances. These include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Trees over 60cm (24 inches) diameter</li>

                            <p>Applying for a tree removal permit typically involves:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Submit application to District of North Vancouver (online or in-person)</li>
                                <li>Provide arborist report justifying removal</li>
                                <li>Pay application fee ($150-$300 typically)</li>
                                <li>Wait 4-6 weeks for review and decision</li>
                                <li>If approved, pay permit fee and any required replacement tree security deposit</li>
                            </ol>
